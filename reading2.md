Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? 
How many CPU cores does a computer need?
What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?

### Question-01: "Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true?"
My anwser based off the atricles provided: I think that the two relate. The higher the core the more the pc can handle in performance which relates to how much it can apply to the speed (GHZ) of the pc.

### Question-02: "How many CPU cores does a computer need?"
My anwser based off the atricles provided: It says for an average pc user 2 or 4 cores is for standard use but for people who do more load bering tasks 6-and up would be more productive. people wo do standard gaming is suggested to have atleats 6 but would be better off with a higher number but isn't required.

### Question-03: "What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?"
My anwser based off the atricles provided: "Onboard Wi-Fi (ensures that your computer will have wireless capabilities) Bluetooth Multiple RAM slots/high RAM capacity Support for graphics cards if necessary (PCIe x16 slot)"
(https://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Computer) More of a crucial part is making sure its compatable with the type of CPU you plan on or already purchased.

### Question-04: "What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?"
My anwser based off the atricles provided: Depending on the budget there isnt many tradeoffs, The hard drives are older and slower in comparison and have moving parts vs the ssd or an M.2 chip. The Hard drives can use IDE which is becoming more out of date because Most SSD'S and m.2/NVMe use SATA. I Have my OS on a HHD and the rest of my syuff on a M.2, boots fast and runs great.

### Question-05: "Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?"
My anwser: I would explain in simple terms, relate the componants to how im learning them. like someone who dosn't know much about pc's calling the CPU the brains of the computer would make more sense.
