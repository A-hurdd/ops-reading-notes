# Overall Lecture Notes

> Computer is Nothing More Than a Machine That Takes in Information and Follows it to a T

Percise instructions are important

### Layers of Abstraction
1. If you are making the hardware you dont really need to know how the software works, You as the one making the hardware are telling the developer how it is gonna be.
2. Need to know how to get information into and out of the database properly.
3. Your assumption is it works or it dosn't work.
4. The higher level the less the detail
   ### The componants of the motherboard
   * Intergrated circuts
   * Transistors
   * Resistors
   * Compactors
     
> The Lower You Get the More Detail You See

The Big Hack made us realize how important it is to study computer components.

### Key Computer Components
> The hardware refers to the tangible physical components of a computer system that can be touched and interacted with.
1. CPU - Central Processing Unit
2. RAM - Random-Acess Memory
3. USB Drives - Universal Serial Bus
4. Serial Ports
5. VGA - Video Graphics Array
6. OS - Operating System
7. BIOS- Basic Input Output System
  > operating system is the controlling aspect that once the computer starts up, it allows you to control all of the hardware

### Stages Of Computing
Input - Input indicates an action by providing some type of input to the computer
The computer is going to take this input and it's going to do something with the input. it's going to process it.
it's gotten some input now, based on my computer programming. I'm going to take this input and I'm going to do something with it.
Your computer is now going to process that. Input. and it's going to do to the best of its ability what you what it thinks it should do now.
Then after it does that processing of the input it's going to give me some kind of output, some kind of result from the task of my input being processed by the computer.
This constant thing of input process output input process output. The computer does this constantly.

### Circut Boards and Logic
> They are the essential components that manipulate electricity to transmit signals within the computer system. They are the building blocks of the computer.
   The Circuts change their value based on the input they recieve, allowing for dynamic processing of electrical signals.
   Logic Gates, integrated within circuts, perform bitwise calculations and logical operations to process and manipulate data.
> It all boils down to the simple numbers of 1 and 0. which basically menas on and off. if a computer sees a 1 it means electricity is applied and the other for 0 means electricity is off.

### Binary and Data
> Binary is a base 2 system ones and zeroes.
This means that we can calculate numbers based on ones and zeroes. Now this breaks down into something called bits and bites.
Okay, in binary, the smallest unit of data is called a bit or a binary bit. And it represents 2 states. This is that 0 or the one that I was talking about. This is the smallest piece of data
