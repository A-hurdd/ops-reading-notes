### What is the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol?
Answer: Secure Shell (SSH) is a modern standard for remoter terminal acess. It is a text only GUI.

### What are the typical uses of the SSH protocol?
Answer: SSH can use password authentication to establish a terminal-only connection to a computer running the SSH service.

### How does the SSH protocol work?
Answer: "The protocol works in the client-server model, which means that the connection is established by the SSH client connecting to the SSH server. The SSH client drives the connection setup process and uses public key cryptography to verify the identity of the SSH server."
"The SSH protocol uses strong symmetric encryption and hashing algorithms to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data that is exchanged between the client and server."

### How is the data kept safe when transmitted between the SSH client and server?
Answer: "The most common ones are passwords and public key authentication."
