## Operating systems

Microsoft dominates pc and server markets.
In the Pc relm the most common Os systems you'd encounter is Mac, Some version of Linux, And winndows.
Windows Xp was depricated in 2013, and was the most stable OS for years. alot of buisnesses used Windows XP because of how stable it was. Alot of companies refused to switch over to windows 11 especially Medical companies still use it especially to run medical equiptment like MRI and X-Ray machines.
# Operating systems-
> all an operating system is that is a core piece of software that manages all the hardware and software packages on your computer.

Interface between application and hardware.
Disk management.
Process management/schedueling.
> Kill a process/end task

Application management.
Memory Management.
Device management.
Acess control/protection.

### Types of OS
Mobile device OS
Workstation OS
Server OS
Embedded OS
Firmware
Hypervisor (Type1)

### Origins of Linux
UNIX OS released in 1970 from AT&T Bell Labrotories and was widely adopted by acedimic institutions and buisnesses

GNU project launched in 1983 to create a free UNIX-like OS

Linux created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and released under GNU public license.

### Why Linux?
Open-Source (free).
 Lightweight and less resource-intensive.
Fewer security/privacy issues
 Community support.
Increased software offsprings in modern era
 Major market share
Highly relevant to cyber security
 Related to certification CompTIA Linux+

  ### Why Ubuntu Linux?
  Its popular for general computer use, it has a simple interface.

  Some other common Linux OS'S
  Red Hat- Great for servers

  CentOS- Great for Enterprise deployments

  Kali- Used for offensive security

  ### Linux CLI (Command Line Interface)

  Linux OS is known for its powerful CLI, not its GUI endpoint usability.
### ---
### Strengths
Great for advanced users and software package handling.

Shell scripting and server administration.

Shared by MacOS

Cyber tools designed for Linux

A networn topology diagram is a visual representation of a network's devices, connections, and paths.

Maps interconnected devices and how they communicate with one another.

Purposes:
Visualize Network Structure

Planning and Design

Troubleshooting and Mantenance

Documentation

https://app.diagrams.net/ (draw.io) is a good topology tool

### Types of Topologies
Bus Topology- Nodes are connected in a linear manner, with each device connected to a single cable or backbone

Star Topology- Nodes are connectedto a central device, such as a switch or a hub, forming a star-like structure.

Ring Topology- Nodes are connected into a closed loop, where data flows in one direction around the ring.

## The Lab Plan
Lab kit PC will run Ubuntu Linux Desktop

Acess from personal computer using microsoft remote desktop protocol (RDP) over port 3389
Also secure Shell over port 22.
Mesh Topology- Nodes are connected to multiple other nodes, creating a redundant and highly interconnected network.

Hybrid Topology- Networks can combine multiple topologies to meet specific requirements.
