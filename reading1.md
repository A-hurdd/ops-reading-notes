The Topic for this reading relates because, we are learning about tearing down and analyzing the componants of our computer and other computing systems. for the "Big Hack" Something so small a chip so miniscule that they wouldn't of found unless doing the same.

> Question #1 "How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?"

My Anwser as sited from the provided website: "Hardware hacks are more difficult to pull off and potentially more devastating, promising the kind of long-term, stealth access that spy agencies are willing to invest millions of dollars and many years to get."

> Question #2 "What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?"

My 2 Anwsers as sited from the website:
1. "There are two ways for spies to alter the guts of computer equipment. One, known as interdiction, consists of manipulating devices as they’re in transit from manufacturer to customer. This approach is favored by U.S. spy agencies, according to documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden."
2. "The other method involves seeding changes from the very beginning." and "A seeding attack would mean developing a deep understanding of a product’s design, manipulating components at the factory, and ensuring that the doctored devices made it through the global logistics chain to the desired location"
