### Reading Number #1

Case Study: China’s Spy Chip

> How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?
Explain how the hack worked.
How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?

The Topic for this reading relates because, we are learning about tearing down and analyzing the componants of our computer and other computing systems. for the "Big Hack" Something so small a chip so miniscule that they wouldn't of found unless doing the same.

> Question #1 "How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?"

My Anwser as sited from the provided website given: "Hardware hacks are more difficult to pull off and potentially more devastating, promising the kind of long-term, stealth access that spy agencies are willing to invest millions of dollars and many years to get."

> Question #2 "What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?"

My 2 Anwsers as sited from the website given:
1. "There are two ways for spies to alter the guts of computer equipment. One, known as interdiction, consists of manipulating devices as they’re in transit from manufacturer to customer. This approach is favored by U.S. spy agencies, according to documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden."
2. "The other method involves seeding changes from the very beginning." and "A seeding attack would mean developing a deep understanding of a product’s design, manipulating components at the factory, and ensuring that the doctored devices made it through the global logistics chain to the desired location"

   > Question #3 "Explain how the hack worked."

   My Anwser as sited from the website given: "The chips allowed the attackers to create a stealth doorway into any network that included the altered machines."
   I believe that from that in more simple terms allowed hackers into the devices with the chips and gave them acess into the information on the devices with said chip.

   > Quetsion #4 "How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?"

   My Anwser as sited from the website given: "To help with due diligence, AWS, which was overseeing the prospective acquisition, hired a third-party company to scrutinize Elemental’s security, according to one person familiar with the process. The first pass uncovered troubling issues, prompting AWS to take a closer look at Elemental’s main product" and "Elemental’s staff boxed up several servers and sent them to Ontario, Canada, for the third-party security company to test. Nested on the servers’ motherboards, the testers found a tiny microchip, not much bigger than a grain of rice, that wasn’t part of the boards’ original design."
   I see it as, The company who had bought the boards sent them off for testing where as they were tesing found the chip. WHO SOLD THEM THE BOARDS ????? "Super Micro Computer inc." One of the world’s biggest suppliers of server motherboards.

   Did they find the specific people who put the chips on the boards?
