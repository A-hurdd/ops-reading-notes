Installing Virtualbox with Linux Terminal
---
## How this topic relates: In the Lecture today we talked about the Lab we are going to be doing later, running virtual box and eventually remote acessing our Lab Kit PC from our home PC!

Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?
Explain what Linux is, using anything except English


### Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
My Answer based off the provided article:  shell stands for the outer part of the operating system, you use it to control files and we use it to operate computing interfaces.
"the ability to pass data from one command straight into another, or to use special wildcard characters to work with lots of similarly named files at once."  https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#2-a-brief-history-lesson

Terminal can be used to communicate with the PC,starting and killing scripts as well as seeing and editing information on your computer.

CLI stands for Command Line Interface, "it’s just another way of talking about a shell running in a terminal." https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#3-opening-a-terminal

Command prompt is a interface that allows you to interact with the OS "First is that when you type a command it appears on the same line as the odd text. That text is there to tell you the computer is ready to accept a command, it’s the computer’s way of prompting you. In fact it’s usually referred to as the prompt"  https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#3-opening-a-terminal


### What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
cd /
pwd

mv is used for both!

### What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?
Relitave path is related to the origional file and absloute paths are the root or main path.
"Note that the directory separator is a forward slash (”/”)" "The “/” directory, often referred to as the root directory, is the base of that unified file system"
"Using the tilde character (”~”) at the start of your path similarly means “starting from my home directory”."
